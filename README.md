# 3D-Scene
Using OpenGL this project creates and renders a custom 3D scene.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project has helped me develop new design skills. I am capable of rendering 3D objects, applying texture and lighting to create realists 3D scenes.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?

I began my design process with analysing a real scene. I than began breaking each object down into its component parts needed to recreate the object.

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Future work can be influenced by this design approach. taking all the neccessray infomrtion and determining the requirments to develop a fucntion production allows for faster and more effective development.

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I used a build and test approach to development. Writting small segemts of the logic then immediatly testing it to reduce future error propagation

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

As I developed my code base some of my approaches to development changed. On main change came with creating clear comment sections that enabled me to easily navigate the code base.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

The new knowledge i gained from this course is highly benefitial. The close relashionship this project has with hardware withh be a highly transferable skill in any future projects. The added benefit of being able to generate 3D models will have both personal and professional benefits.
